          Psalteries have different names in different countries such as KANTELE,
          PSALTERY, KOKLE, KANNEL, KANKLES, GUSLI. It is a musical string instrument
          of ancient origin, which from ancient times was famous for its
          enchanting sound. The psaltery is considered the oldest type and
          progenitor of other stringed instruments. When playing, the instrument
          is usually in the lap, plucking with two hands to extract the sounds,
          or only the right hand, and the left hand muffles the strings. Simple
          songs or improvisational compositions is not difficult to create on
          the psaltery without any experience, due to the simple selection of
          melody of the sound of the strings, because whatever string you take
          all sounds beautiful and harmonious. Psalter was originally not only a
          musical instrument, with their help, people conveyed their thoughts,
          feelings and knowledge. Psalter consists of a flat oblong long
          hollowed or assembled body, bottom deck and top deck with holes for
          soundboard, pins for the tension of strings, string-holder, along the
          front deck strings are stretched like a fan. The name is given by the
          appearance of the back part which protrudes after a row of pegs in the
          form of a wing. For manufacture can be used wood of coniferous and
          deciduous species, such as: spruce, pine, maple, oak, cedar, alder,
          etc. The scale is diatonic, usually in a major scale. Basically for
          the making of psaltery there are only small workshops, which are
          created by true lovers of antiquity. Psaltery is perhaps one of the
          most interesting folk instruments. And if you think that their life is
          a thing of the past, it is not so at all, more and more people
          recognize and show interest in this instrument.

          The lyre is an ancient stringed plucked musical instrument from the
          14th-16th centuries. It has a flat rounded body, usually has 7 nylon
          strings, but may have more. It consists of a wooden body, sound
          resonator cavity connected by a partition with two handles. The lyre
          is a musical legacy from ancient times: this stringed instrument has
          been widespread in many countries and has been updated by different
          civilizations and given different shapes and names. The lyre is
          considered the most popular surviving type of medieval stringed
          musical instrument. One popular type of medieval lyre is the Kravik
          Lyre, a handcrafted stringed instrument that we offer you in an
          updated modern form with a custom design.
